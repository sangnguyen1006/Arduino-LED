# Arduino-LED
## [Task 1] 
Programming for 4 leds on the Shield to blink according to the modes at the given 
frequency (for example: flashing alternately and alternating 4 leds, alternately flashing 
2 right leds then 2 left leds, ...) . There are at least 2 modes, use one of the 2 buttons 
(SW) to switch between modes.

## [Task 2] 
Program the flash to turn off from 3 or more modes and use both buttons to switch in the 
order of the modes (for example, each time sw1 is pressed, the light changes from mode 1 
-> mode 2 -> mode 3, each time sw2 is pressed, it switches from mode 3 -> mode 2 -> mode1).

## [Task 3] 
Programming when changing the value of the rheostat will change the blinking speed of the leds.
